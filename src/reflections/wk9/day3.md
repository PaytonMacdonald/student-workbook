## Daily Journal - Read Working In a Professional Environment > Scrum for Small teams

1. How are some ways Scrum for a small team would differ from Scrum with a large team?

A small team is more agile, I'm assuming small team is our group and a large team would be 10-20.

A large team would have much heavier control over work flow from tasks to task while a smaller team would be more flexible with how things get done

2. Why does Scrum prescribe to only run 1 sprint at a time.

keep it simple, easy as that

3. What is the unattainable triangle and what purpose does it have in Scrum?

cheap work done good will not be fast
good work done fast will not be cheap
fast work done cheap will not be good

the purpose it has in scrum is knowing which one you are and working with it rather than against it.

# Day 1 - Capstones

## Daily Journal - Reflect on your capstone

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

The languages we use are: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue.js, Node.js, SASS and the Bootstrap css framework, oh and mongoose I forgot about that one

The other technologies we used was Auth0, MongoDB, Postman, and VS Code

2. What went well so far?

Delegation of tasks went well, learning as a team went well, and progress was made everyday.

3. What would you do differently? Why?

I would have let my team drive more. I was trying to be product owner when I was not. There are a lot of things I would have done differently but I was not in charge. I can only critique myself so I'd say I should have looked at the bigger picture and lowered my expectations for the project as a whole.

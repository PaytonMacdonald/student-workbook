# Day 5 - END WEEK 10

## Daily Journal - Weekly Reflections (Optional)

# This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

This was a tricky week. It was hard to be motivated to code this time around. Things were new but not totally different. I understand the structure of C# with servers more than I realize. I'm just losing the passion to code new assignments right now. 

It's probably because of how my Capstone turned out. Deep down... I guess I'm still really disappointed with the end result. I was really hoping to create something phenominal, but it did not turn out how I was hoping. Now my name is attached to something I'm not proud of. It's driving me crazy, leaving lack luster work behind. 

Especially when I was planning on putting it on my resume. I really tried my best too, but that product is just not... good. At least not in it's current state. 

I mean, even my kanban was better than my capstone, it's frustrating!

So, until I have the time, it'll just have to sit unfinished. Life will just continue to move forward, so onto to the final project.

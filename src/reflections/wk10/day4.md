# Day 4 - BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS WITH MYSQL & AUTH0

## Daily Journal - Read Foundations of C# > C# Enum's and answer the following questions

1. What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?

it's like a way to make something constant

2. How can you modify an Enum?

with the words low, medium, and high

3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)

I have never seen an Enum in any project I've used... I guess I could have used it to keep data consistant in gregslist I suppose. Maybe a set price? I don't know...

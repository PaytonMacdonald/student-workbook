# Day 1 - INTRODUCTION TO C#

## Daily Journal - Read Foundations of C# > C# Data Types and answer the following questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

INT - these are numbers 1 2 3
CHAR - these are just characters 'a' 'b' 'c'
STRING - these are any colleciton of characters "abc"

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

value type holds data in it's own space... I'm not sure javascript can do that since it just reads straight on ahead

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?

reference takes from data that already exists and is just... used, it isn't really stored because it already exists

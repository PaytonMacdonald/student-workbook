# Day 3 - CHECKPOINT

## Daily Journal - Read Advancing with Vue 3 > Designing a Strong User Experience and answer the following questions

1. What is a User Experience? What should be considered when developing a User Experience?

From the top of my head it's how easily understood your design is. Over cluttered or baren design can prevent a user from staying or interacting with any application.

Colors, spacing, wording, accessability, simplicity and so many things must be taken in consideration in order to improve user experience.

2. What are some benefits of taking into account the User Experience?

People will stay and use your app. People will get something out of it. The key benefits will be used and your overall pride will be bolstered. 

User Experience is my favorite thing and I want to be an expert at it.

3. Why is the User Experience important?

As an advertising major and having started my career in marketing, what the User goes through is everything. They must understand how to use an application with 0 experience. Simplicity and useability are what I will strive for.

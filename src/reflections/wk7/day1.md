## Daily Journal - Read Advancing with Vue 3 > Pair Programming and answer the following questions

1. What is Pair Programming? What are the roles and how do they work?

It is when there are two programmers working on a task. There is the navigator who... you know what here's the definition:

Pair programming consists of two programmers sharing a single workstation (one screen, keyboard and mouse among the pair). The programmer at the keyboard is usually called the "driver", the other, also actively involved in the programming task but focusing more on overall direction is the "navigator"; it is expected that the programmers swap roles every few minutes or so.

2. What are some benefits of Pair Programming?

Badaboom, this is from the reading:

it leads to clearer articulation of the complexities and hidden details in coding tasks, reducing the risk of error or going down blind alleys
better diffusion of knowledge among the team
improved resiliency of a pair to interruptions, compared to an individual developer

3. What are some drawbacks to Pair Programming?

from the potential costs section:

While empirical studies have yet to yield definite results on either benefits or costs, a commonly cited best-case estimate of 15% overhead is claimed for systematic pairing, relative to individual work; this overhead, it is claimed (again with some empirical support, though not entirely conclusive), is compensated by gains in code quality which usually entails significant maintenance penalties down the road

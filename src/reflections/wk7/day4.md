# Day 4 - CHECKPOINT

## Daily Journal - Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

I wokred hard and did my journels last minute. So none. But I'd say we were successful at basic Pair Programming expectations as a navigator and driver.

2. What went well?

I played navigator and my partner drove. I did it to give them as much expierience as possible because at that point I was doing well in the course due to my past experience with coding and project management in general. 

We stayed very organized and that was our biggest benefit.

3. What would you do differently?

I should have implemented code documentation as well as advance the expectations of proper pair coding.

I drove and navigated during CSS styling and I wonder how I could have made the other involved more.

# Day 4 - CAPSTONE

## Daily Journal - Read Working In a Professional Environment > Testing in Vue and answer the following questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

Unit Testing
Component Testing
End-To-End (E2E) Testing

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

I think i've decided component testing, because it feels like the real in between testing that covers little bits as well as entire connections thorugh the frontend and backend.

It seems to be the tests that let you see real progress.

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

that's a hard one, unit testing seems to be great at finding the smallest mistakes, and e2e testing takes a while but it looks like it accomplishes so much. I'm going to go with the latter though, e2e seems best for when you have time to double check all testing.

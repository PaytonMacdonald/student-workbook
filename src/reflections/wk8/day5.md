# Day 5 - CAPSTONE

## Daily Journal - Weekly Reflections (Optional)

This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The first week of capstone was difficult for me. My group is not as adept as I am with coding, there's so much I'd like to do and want to do but I feel chained down by their inefficient methods and dismisal of my talents.

But that's not what's important here.

I need to be more humble, I need to find the best way to work with my team, not against. No project will be perfect and I'm not the greatest coder to ever live. I'm just a little more natually in tune, so I need to remember my place as a student.

I will strive to help and assist, not pull and complain. There is still so much more I need to learn when it comes to myself.

# Day 2 - CAPSTONE

## Daily Journal - Read Working In a Professional Environment > Scrum for Small Teams and answer the following questions

1. Why is communication on a small team important?

communication on any team is important. a happy friendly hard working team can accomplish so much. but a miscomunication and a rough spot in relationship can lead to a very weak end result.

2. What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?

in a small team, in my own opinion everyone needs to have some form of ownership on the project. whether it's how it looks, a special function, or how the backend is constructed. Giving someone ownership will lead to passion and responsibility.


3. What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?

Good service Cheap won't be Fast - people who aint good don't cost much but they'll make mistakes if you want things done right quickly

Good service Fast won't be Cheap - the best of the best is in high demand so basic economics dictate supply and demand. to lower demand, good work be pricy.

Fast service Cheap won't be Good - i mean what did you really expect?

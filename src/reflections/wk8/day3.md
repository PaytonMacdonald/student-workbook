# Day 3 - CAPSTONE

## Daily Journal - Read Working In a Professional Environment > Unit Testing and answer the following questions

1. What is Software Development Testing?

i don't know, that wording isn't used in the reading 
(i used cntrl-f and didn't find anything!)

if we're talking about UNIT testing this is what the reading described:
- that they are supposed to test the smallest unit of code. The definition is vague out of necessity: it's up to the developer to decide what the unit of code is.

2. What are the benefits of Testing in software development?

- that's like asking "why should you proofread your papers?" nobody, NOBODY, writes anything perfectly all the time. Especially not code, and when code has a small mistake an entire application can crash.

3. What are some potential drawbacks of Testing in software development?

- time waste, miscommunicaiton, and the requirement of precise organization especially with a large team.

# Day 4 - AUDIO/VIDEO TAGS AND REVIEW

## Daily Journal - Read Asynchronous Code > What is REST and answer the following questions

1. What does REST stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean?

REpresentational State Transfer, it means if an API considered REST gets called, then the server will transfer to the client a representation of the state of the requested resource... so it like just gets a basic version of what you asked for instead all the damn data.

2. What does Stateless mean?

it means the server will not remember anything about the user who is called the API

3. What URL pattern is used when writing a RESTful API?

I have no idea what you mean when you ask for a URL pattern... are you talking about when calling the API, so like http;//dasAPI.com/thing/otherthing

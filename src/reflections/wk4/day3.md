# Day 3 - WORKING WITH MULTIPLE API'S

## Daily Journal - Read Asynchronous Code > Async and Await and answer the following questions

1. What is the purpose of Async/Await?

with async it causes a function to be skipped so that javascript can continue and not pause... the await causes the funciton to jump to the front of the line when the data comes back from the API

2. What must you do in order to await a promise inside of a function?

set up the async properly? what are you looking for with this question??

3. What are some of the primary benefits of Async/Await?

since javascript is single thread it allows for the program to move forward and more importantly NOT CRASH

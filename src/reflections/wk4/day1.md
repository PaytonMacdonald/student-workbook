# Day 1 - INTRO TO ASYNCHRONOUS CODE

## Daily Journal - Read Asynchronous Code > Callback Hell and answer the following questions
1. What are some of the signs and causes of ***Callback Hell?***

The cause of callback hell is when people try to write JavaScript in a way where execution happens visually from top to bottom

2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?

asynchronous means, functions will still run and move forward but when the one stopped on returns it gets pushed to the front of the queue and handled immidiately. Javascript can only do one thing at a time after all.

3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix ***Callback Hell***

- keep your code shallow: less things happening the better
- modularize: package your functions and connect them via files instead
- Handle every single error: DON'T LET ANY THROUGH FIX THEM WHEN YOU SEE THEM

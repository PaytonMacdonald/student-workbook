# Day 5 - END WEEK 12

## Daily Journal - This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

Well, this is it. The last coding day. Next comes Career Week and then the job hunt begins. I was holding out to see if I might get a spot as a TA but that is not looking likely, so it's time to move on. 

Even after all I have done, I still feel drawn back to a marketing career. I'm going to be looking at Front End Development positions. I'm starting to remember the reason why I came to a coding bootcamp. I couldn't go much further with web design if I didn't know coding. 

So I'm going to study more CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. I'll continue learning C# but I don't have much interest in MySQL and databasing. It's important to understand it and write the very basics but I don't think I could do heavy-server work in my career.

The techniques of User-interface and User-experience are what I want to pursue and master.

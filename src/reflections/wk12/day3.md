# Day 3 - FINAL CHECKPOINT

## Daily Journal - During this final checkpoint simply journal your progress as you build the app. What have you achieved so far, what are you working on now, and what roadblocks are you currently overcoming. Feel free to take this time to express how you are feeling now at the end of the course, reflecting on everything you have learned so far.

I completed my postman tests, and I recieved my first grading. I only have 4 things left to do so it should be easy.

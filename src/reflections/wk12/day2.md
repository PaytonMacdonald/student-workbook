# Day 2 - FINAL CHECKPOINT

## Daily Journal - During this final checkpoint simply journal your progress as you build the app. What have you achieved so far, what are you working on now, and what roadblocks are you currently overcoming. Feel free to take this time to express how you are feeling now at the end of the course, reflecting on everything you have learned so far.

I made a whole lot of progress today. Turns out the only reason my CRUD routes weren't working was a very simple reason. I forgot to implement my transients in the startup file. Ridiculous! My postman tests still are not done today. I feel behind. I'll need a steady plan before I can pass.

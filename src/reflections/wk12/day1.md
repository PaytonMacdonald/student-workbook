# Day 1 - FINAL CHECKPOINT

## Daily Journal - During this final checkpoint simply journal your progress as you build the app. What have you achieved so far, what are you working on now, and what roadblocks are you currently overcoming. Feel free to take this time to express how you are feeling now at the end of the course, reflecting on everything you have learned so far.

There is no class today. My server does not past Postman testing but the framework is built. I have all my routes covered they just... aren't working. So I will do what I can and build the frontend as far as possible. I'll get the design down and done at least.

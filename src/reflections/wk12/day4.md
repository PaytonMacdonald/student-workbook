# Day 4 - FINAL CHECKPOINT

## Daily Journal - During this final checkpoint simply journal your progress as you build the app. What have you achieved so far, what are you working on now, and what roadblocks are you currently overcoming. Feel free to take this time to express how you are feeling now at the end of the course, reflecting on everything you have learned so far.

I have been working on my last four requirements all day and I really only accomplished one of them in class. I did my second grading today and I re-failed a seperate check and a few different bugs appeared. I'll finish tomorrow but I'm disappointed I didn't finish today. I'll have to put in extra work tonight to make this deadline. No problem.

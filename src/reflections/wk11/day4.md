# Day 4 - FULL-STACK REVIEW

## Daily Journal - Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your final project, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

This is the final project. I'm a little overwhelmed honestly. I've been able to handle just about everything except the Network at this point. I need a lot of help with that one... 

As for my plan. I will break down my work into sections. Have goals for each day and take a break when I meet those goals. Then I'll push further if time permits. Anything I can do to the fullest I'll do on the weekend. Anything I can't do I'll code as far as I can and seek help during the final week.

I'm worried I won't be able to past postman tests until really late in the week.

I have enjoyed projects that let me have a bit of freedom to mess around like Moon Miner and Kanban. I like the projects I was able to complete and spend extra time on like Kanban and BugLog. I use those as reference for my work constantly. Even more so than the class examples. 
I love the full work I've done like Moon Miner, Kanban, and Buglog... but I really don't like the halfbaked work I've done, like the Network, Inspire and my Capstone.

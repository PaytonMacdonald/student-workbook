# Day 1 - INHERITANCE AND INTERFACES

## Daily Journal -Read Foundations of C# > C# Inheritance and answer the following questions

1. What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?

allows data to be connected and used from 'parents' to 'children'
that way all the data can be more organized across multiple files rather than smushed all in one file.

2. How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?

Member inheritance uses public, private, and internal type tagging which controls what is can be accessed at specific moments with certain code.

3. How does accessibility affect inheritance?

Sometimes certain things are not visable which directly effects visability. Once you mess with visability you have to keep accessibility in mind.

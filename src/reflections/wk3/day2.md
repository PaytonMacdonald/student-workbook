# Day 2 - Encapsulation

## Daily Journal - Read Advancing with JS > Encapsulation in JavaScript and answer the following questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?
    it prevents public users from accessing specific data that is meant to only be accessed by a developer
2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?
- breaking changes
- leaked implimentation details
- expanding attack surface for hackers
- self documenting code
3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?
- the only time we used something that involved the anything ES6 was when we used a pluggin that applied HTML syntax coloring into javascript. So I assume ES6 is when we create data using the template builder. It creates objects right on the draw but it's kept within a private section of the document because of the draw. We do this for organization convenience of drawing multiple assets and keeping them unchangable as well.

# Day 1 - JAVASCRIPT CLASSES

## Daily Journal - Read Advancing with JS > ES6 modules and answer the following questions

1. What problem does using exports solve?

it keeps files more organized so that when called it doesn't have to load ALL of them but rather just one at a time.

2. How does export differ from export default?

regular exort needs to be named, and default is... well the default

3. What is a benefit of using the Module System?

it allows you to load individual classes and data without having to load an entire javascript file

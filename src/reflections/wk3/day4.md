# Day 4 - 

## Daily Journal - Read Advancing with JS > The Observer Pattern and answer the following questions

1. What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?

apps and files can get really big, this pattern keeps all that data synced and organized

2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

subscribe, unsubscribe, and broadcast

3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.

from what I understand the observer is that ProxyState function. it overlooks all the data we write and allows it to maneauver around file to file of the MVC in so many ways. Currently I still really is magic because there is a lot of in between that i don't understand at the moment.

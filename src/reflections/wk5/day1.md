# Day 1 - INTRO TO NODEJS

## Daily Journal - Read Servers with Node/Express > Using Query Parameters and answer the following questions

1. What is the purpose of a Query String?

from the reading: A query string allows you to pass information to and from a website by simply adding, or “appending,” that information to the end of a URL.

2. What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?

the key=value pairs... it starts with a ? i think, then if you use more than one you seperate them with &

3. When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?

I don't super understand my servers yet so... I'l come back to this one.

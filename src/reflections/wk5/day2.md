# Day 2 - USING AN ORM TO INTERACT WITH A DATABASE

## Daily Journal - Read Servers with Node/Express > MongoDb Relationships and answer the following questions

1. What are the three types of relationships?

one-to-one: a relationship between two entities

one-to-many: a relationship where one side can have more than one relationship while the reverse relationship can only be single sided

many-to-many: an example of a relationship between two entities where they both might have many relationships between each other


2. What are the benefits of the traditional linking of relationships instead of Embedding

it's simpler and can handle many different tasks through many different layers of coding.


3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?

there are a lot of layers of complexity once you step into the many-to-many territory... it seems best to focus on the planning, make sure you know what you want what you need and how it'll fit... don't throw curve balls halfway through and make what you're coding work.

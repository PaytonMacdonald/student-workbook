## Daily Journal -Read Frontend Frameworks with Vue3 > Using Nested Routes in Vue.js and answer the following questions

1. What is a nested route?

Nested routes allow for more complex user interfaces with components nested inside each other

2. When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)

forms, graphs, anything that will have data inside of data, once you're a couple steps in Nested routes seem to be the best option.

3. Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?

yes, you would pass them through if you have multiple parameters or maybe id's to keep track of. I can imagine a lot of ways.

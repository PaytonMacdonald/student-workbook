# Day 3 - Cheating at Design

## Daily Journal - Cheating at Design
***because I guess that's okay***

Read Building Blocks Of Web Development > Cheating At Design and answer the following questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

despite having a design background, and have created multiple layouts with font and colors... I really liked quite a few of these.

My favorite tip was the very first about not making fonts bigger, because i've done that... as well as making them heavier or lighter...

In other words: I am not going to mess with font ***size*** as much as I normally do.

2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

I now use Pantone's vast color library for all my color choices. I've decided not to pick my own colors anymore because Pantones are perfected colors that have all the information they need.

I'm going to also ingrain myself with font awesome as my default icon choice. I prefer to make my own icons but now I understand that my time can be better utilized... CODES GOTTA GET DONE

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

Design is like a personality. A good first impression is warming and welcome. Too much personality will scare a user away, and not enough will leave them staring not wanting anything but instead moving on to the next page.

A good powerful design *keeps* people. A poor design or worse, any design that contains red flags like notifications, pop-ups, or anything users always hate, will turn them away.

A good design also *guides* people. Using the right colors and the right fonts pulls the eyes where they need to go. It controls the thoughts to wear they need to be. Distractions in poor design can easily confuse any user. Including myself.

If they don't stay, or they don't understand what they need to do... then as a designer I failed.

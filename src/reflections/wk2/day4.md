2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

**low-fidelity:** only includes vital elements using imagery, usually done with sketches on paper.
**mid-fidelity:** a hybrid in between of max detail vs the bare minimum
**high-fidelity:** ditching the pen and pencil for some polished pixels

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

Planning is everything. The better the plan, the better a developler can accomplish the big three goals: 1. make it work, 2. make it better 3. make it faster

It also speeds up development time significantly. Because every decision for the page has already been decided and the work is to fill in the blanks of the wireframe.

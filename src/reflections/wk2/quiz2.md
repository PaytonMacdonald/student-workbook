I googled and found this:
Single Responsibility Principle - be amazing at one thing
Open-Closed Principle - code can be changed but doesn't need to be re-written
Liskov Substitution Principle - I DON'T UNDERSTAND, SOMETHING IS BUT AIN'T
Interface Segregation Principle - keep it simple, keep it clean
Dependency Inversion Principle - give the caller the power
```
**4.** Given this array: 
```js
let fruit = ['apple', 'banana', 'pineapple',  'orange', 'strawberry']
``` 
What index is the pineapple's current position? How do you know?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

pineapple is at position 2 because arrays start at zero [0, 1, 2, 3]
```
**5.** With these two objects: 
```js
let you = { name:"You", hair: true, friends: [] }
let them = { name:"Them", hair: false, friends: [] }

**7.** In the `for loop` below, what is the name of the piece belongs inside the empty "______" space? What would you put here to increase `i` by one on every iteration?
```js
for ( let i = 0; i < arr.length; _______ ) {
  //...

i++ but I didn't know it had a name... is it an incrementation?

<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

parameters are in functions

arguments are for things that call *to* the function parameters
```
**11.** What is the difference between a `primitive` value and a `reference` value?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
primative is defined easily with one piece of data
reference is a collection of more data, it is a collection of primative elements and other various things

# Day 3 - INTERACTING WITH THE DOM AND EVENTS


## Daily Journal 
***Read Intro to JS > Chrome Developer Tools and answer the following questions***

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

With the inspect tool you can test and write multiple custom tests and proccesses before actually editing the entire document.

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

is this talking about the actual inspect tool? or one of the tabs *in* the inspect tool? if it's the latter I assume we're talking about the **elements** tab

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

probably by using the debugger function or by manualing clicking through each line via the inspect tool

# Day 2 - HTML/CSS

## Daily Journal - JAVASCRIPT FUNCTIONS, OBJECTS, AND LOOPS

***Read Intro to JS > JavaScript Functions and answer the following questions***

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

function name(parameters) { // statements 

let name = function(parameters) {
    // statements
}

let name = (parameters) => {
    // statements
}

2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

parameters are in the function name()

arguments are out of the function
name()

3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

things like .map and .find are higher order functions
they help make loops or specific tasks much easier... i've been calling them methods though
